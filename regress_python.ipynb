        "Tutorial video: [data simulation and linear regression exercise in python](https://youtu.be/kJnrAdaxiqI)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will generate linear data and 'fit' a linear model to the data 'by hand' using python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear models underlie the vast majority of classical statistics, form the foundation for machine learning methods and are the basic building blocks for neural networks. So, if you really 'get' linear models, you have a solid foundation for doing most of contemporary AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that linear models are just functions or equations of the form\n",
        "\n",
        "    y = m * x + b\n",
        "\n",
        "where the variable \"x\" stores your predictors, and \"y\" is the value you'd like to predict. The 'parameters' \"m\" and \"b\" are free parameters of the linear model, giving the slope (m) and y-intercept (b), respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"y=mx+b\" equation gives you an *infinite* number of lines, one for each pair of values for the parameters, m and b. The purpose of \"fitting\" the linear model to data (called \"training\" the model, in the machine-learning and artificial-intelligence fields) is to identify the 'best' specific values for \"m\" and \"b\", given a specific data set of x,y pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why fit a linear model to training data?\n",
        "\n",
        "In most cases, we have gathered x,y data from an experiment or from observations, and we want to understand the relationship between the predictors (x) and the response (y). In some cases, we may just be intellectually curious about the world, and we want to know how y is related to x. For example, we might want to know how polar bear habitat has been impacted by global climate change.\n",
        "\n",
        "In many cases, we want to fit our model so that we can 'predict' the response that we would likely observe for a *new* x-value. For example, maybe we want to 'predict' whether a patient is at high risk for a certain type of cancer, based on their lab results. Or perhaps we want to build a model to 'predict' how much irrigation we need to apply to a field of strawberries to achieve optimum growth, given weather data over the past three weeks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whatever our reason for fitting a model to data, once we begin the process of fitting a *linear* model, we are making the *assumption* that the relationship between x and y follows the equation\n",
        "\n",
        "    y = m * x + b\n",
        "\n",
        "and *not* some other equation or functional form. This assumption generates a *bias* associated with the model we have chosen to use. A linear model will *always* be a straight line, whether the relationship between x and y is linear or not. If the relation is (approximately) linear, then fitting a linear model is probably appropriate, and - once fit - our model will probably give us reasonably accurate predictions. However, if the *real* relationship between x and y is *not* linear, assuming a linear model is likely to give us predictions that are *not* valid and could be horribly wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing the appropriate model for the specific x,y data often requires balancing many factors, including our background knowledge of the experiment or observation, how much computational resources and time we have available, and how many x,y pairs we have to train or fit our model. The sub-field of data science or statistics that deals with choosing the model is called \"model selection\".\n",

        "\n",
        "In the 'real world', our training data often comes from experiments or observations, but for now we just want to practice fitting linear models.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Simulated' training data is used by data scientists to characterize and understand models, figure out when models work well and when they don't, and develop new methods and techniques that effectively overcome the limitations of previous approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, we want to better understand how linear models are fit to data. The first step in this process is to simulate data that *does* obey the assumptions of the linear model. That is, we want to simulate x,y pairs that *do* follow the relationship\n",

We then select a value for x (either deterministically or stochastically). Once we have specified values for m,b and x, we can calculate y=mx+b, and then stochastically generate a 'random draw' from the normal distribution N(0,σ) and add this value to y to generate the 'error'.\n",
